Currently having problems:
1) Currently if a payment is not possible to route then I go to the next round. 
The problem arrise if a payment is not possible to route, I keep checking untill the number of rounds are over.
When do I stop to check if a payment if not possible?
Do I route it using all the spanning trees and if its isnt possible to route in anyone of them
I delcare it as unsucceful, should I do this in a single round?

Round the weight to the hundreths place.

Average 


(Round)
Each round would jsut have one attempt (hope its a success)
fails then you loose that round 

6  -> st

Notion of epoch: (and ordering of trees within an epoch) [6 rounds]

[Start by using the trees from the ordering]

unsucceful path list ->

for each src->dest pair (i,j) ; there would be a list of unsuccesful paths. At the end of epoch poch everthing is reset. 

create cycles of random (random length)

Introduce an epoch, within each epoch choose a random tree index. and route all payemtns for the demand matrix
(n^2 - n, basically the size of the demand matrix)
