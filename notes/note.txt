Currently having problems:
1) Currently if a payment is not possible to route then I go to the next round. 
The problem arrise if a payment is not possible to route, I keep checking untill the number of rounds are over.
When do I stop to check if a payment if not possible?
Do I route it using all the spanning trees and if its isnt possible to route in anyone of them
I delcare it as unsucceful, should I do this in a single round?

Round the weight to the hundreths place.

Average 


(Round)
Each round would jsut have one attempt (hope its a success)
fails then you loose that round 

6  -> st

Notion of epoch: (and ordering of trees within an epoch) [6 rounds]

[Start by using the trees from the ordering]

unsucceful path list ->

for each src->dest pair (i,j) ; there would be a list of unsuccesful paths. At the end of epoch poch everthing is reset. 

create cycles of random (random length) 


9/23
Introduce an epoch, within each epoch choose a random tree index. and route all payemtns for the demand matrix
(n^2 - n, basically the size of the demand matrix)

Scaling the demand matrix: [this was a comment in generate_circulation.py]
"""

    250K [sum total of all the demands], howevre the demand density should remain the same. 
    
	compute the sum of the entries of the demand matrix and thel like scale them such that the sum of the entries is close to a target vraiable. [50*num_rounds]
 
    max I can send is credit_amt * number of rounds, so a potential target can be half of this value.
    
    scale the demand by a non zero integer.
